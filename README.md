# Deprecated: Knative Eventing Camel Source

This repository will no longer be maintained and will be archived after the 0.23 release of Knative.

Please visit the [Kamelet catalog at Apache](https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/latest/) for an up-to-date collection of
Knative sources and sinks based on Apache Camel.

Each entry of the catalog contains information on how to use it in a Knative environment, together with
general guides on prerequisite installation.

Kamelets are also supported in the `kn` CLI through the [kn-source-kamelet](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-source-kamelet) addon.
